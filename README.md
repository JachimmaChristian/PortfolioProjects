This repo contains some data exploration I did with SQL as well as the datasets I used for the exploration in case you'd like to try out the project yourself.

This repo contains:

# Data exploration with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS)
The start of COVID-19 in 2019 caused big changes in health, society, the economy, and nature. These changes keep affecting us every day and might last a long time.
For this project, I analyzed and explored the global COVID-19 pandemic data in SSMS. 

The data was sourced from [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). View my codes [here](https://github.com/JachimmaChristian/SQL-Projects-Repo/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Portfolio%20Project1%20-%20Christian%20Jachimma%20C..SQL)

**SQL Skills demonstrated:** Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

# Cleaning Nashville Housing Data In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
