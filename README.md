# Data exploration with Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio(SSMS)
The start of COVID-19 in 2019 caused big changes in health, society, the economy, and nature. These changes keep affecting us every day and might last a long time.
For this project, I analyzed and explored the global pandemic COVID-19 Data. 

The data was sourced from [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). View my codes [Here]()
